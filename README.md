Improving web development skills by working on practical projects. One of these projects includes building a platform similar to Netflix, using technologies like Stripe Checkout and Webhooks. Additionally, I'll be implementing Redux, Firestore, and Google Authentication within a React.js environment to enhance the functionality of the platform.
